# Welcome! 👋

I'm Marie, an **Instructional Designer** dedicated to creating learning experiences that actually stick. 

I believe that good design is invisible—if a learner can move through a course without getting frustrated by the "how," they can focus entirely on the "what."

### What I'm currently working on:
* 🎓 Refining my portfolio.
* 🛠️ Experimenting with AI in education.
* ☕ Drinking way too much coffee.
